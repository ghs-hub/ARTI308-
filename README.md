Assignment 1 for ARTI308 - Machine Learning course

Hello, my name is Ghina Alshehri. 

I'm currently in my junior year in university, majoring in artificial intelligence. I've always had an interest in learning about machine learning as I see it as one of the fundamental concepts in my major, and for that reason I'm so excited to finally be taking this course in this semester. I'm hopeful that it will strengthen my knowledge and my problem solving skills, and will help me in applying AI solutions to the real world. In my free time, I really enjoy going to the movies.
