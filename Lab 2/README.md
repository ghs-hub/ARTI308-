**Heart Disease Dataset Description**
The type of dataset I have chosen for this assignment is classification, where it simply tells you whether the patient has heart disease or not.
The target field values are 0 for patients who do **not** have the disease, and 1 for those who **do**
The rest of the columns include general information about the patients and their medical history, such as : Gender, Age, Chest pain type, resting blood pressure and more.
